# Task List CLI

Simple CLI app to create, list and delete tasks. Follows the [Gophercises](https://courses.calhoun.io/lessons/les_goph_35) course.

## Possible add-ons

- add created-time
- allow updating of tasks
- solf-delete
- Use REST/gRPC remote service and just use CLI to communicate with that
